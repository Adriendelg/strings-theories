Melody is the unfolding of single note lines. It's the shape a series of [[pitch|pitches]] take, it's the musical equivalent of a sentence. Just like language, melodies have inflections, accents, punctuation. A melody is something you can sing, a great melody is one that you can't forget. When you think of a song, the first thing that comes to mind is its melody.
