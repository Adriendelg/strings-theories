Melody is the unfolding of single note lines. It's the shape a series of [[pitch|pitches]] take, it's the musical equivalent of a sentence. Just like language, melodies have inflections, accents, punctuation. A melody is something you can sing, a great melody is one that you can't forget. When you think of a song, the first thing that comes to mind is its melody.  

Of the three pillars of [[music theory]], melody is the hardest to study. You can deeply study [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]] but it is very hard to quantify, analyse and teach what makes a great melody.

# how melodies work
Let's take the example of a song everyone knows: Happy Birthday. 

```music-abc
X:1
T:Happy Birthday
M:3/4
L:1/4
K:C
G/2G/2 | A G c | B2 G/2G/2 | A G d | c2 G/2G/2 | g e c | B A f/2f/2 | e c d | c2 ||
```

First, we can observe that this melody can be divided into 4 shorter phrases each starting with a double 8th note [[pick up]] on the previous bar. 


> [!NOTE] Dividing melodies
> Melodies can often be divided into smaller musical phrases or motifs.

Then we can notice that each of these shorter phrases share a similar structure, they share the same [[rhythm]] and three of them start on the same two notes. 


> [!NOTE] Repeating and developing motifs
> Great melodies make use of motifs, small musical fragments, that repeat and develop over time. This is called [[motivic development]] and is the key to strong melodies.

Finally melodies, just like speech have punctuation, [[tension and release]]. 

Melodies don't exist in a vacuum, they always evolve in a [[harmonic context]]. A [[tonal music|tonal]] song like Happy Birthday has a chord progression on which the melody is sung. 

Happy birthday's structure can be analysed thus: 

1. establishing an idea, a motif that ends on the third of the [[dominant]] chord creating tension
```music-abc
X:1
T:Motif
M:3/4
L:1/4
K:C
"I C"G/2G/2 | "I C"A G c | "V G7"B2

```


2. first variation on the idea, this time ending on the [[tonic]] providing resolution, note that the melody also increases in [[range]]
```music-abc
X:1
T:First variation
M:3/4
L:1/4
K:C
"I C"G/2G/2 |"V G7"A G d |"I C" c2

```


3. second variation, much wider [[intervals|interval]] leap this time hitting the [[sub dominant]] IV chord and ending on the [[dominant]] for tensionÏ€p
