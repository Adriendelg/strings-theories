The capo â€“ short for capodastre â€“ is a tool that is particular to the guitar which allows for easy [[transposition]]. It acts as a constant [[barre chords]] by raising the pitch of the open strings by any number of [[the 12 semitones|half steps]] depending on where it is placed on the neck. 

Capos come in different models, material and shapes but they all perform the same function of keeping a barre chord on. 

# why it's useful
## easy transposition
As guitar players we love to make use of open strings and to keep chord shapes as simple as possible. This means some [[tonality|keys]] will be easier to play in depending on the [[tunings|tuning]]. Standard tuning makes playing in the sharp side of the [[tonality#circle of fifths|circle of fifths]] easier. 

But letâ€™s say you need to play a song in Fmin while staying in standard tuning. You could use a lot of barre chords or avoid open strings altogether but this is not only a very un-guitaristic approach it wonâ€™t offer the best sounding chords. 

One simple solution would be to put a capo on the first fret and â€˜thinkâ€™ in the much friendlier Emin key. You can now freely use your open strings spelling C and F and all the familiar Emin chords and licks you know. 

## when you need a much higher tuning sound
The capo can also be a musical tool in order to change the typical range of the guitar. By placing a high capo you alter the overall resonances of the guitar by changing the [[harmonics]] it naturally generates. It also allows you to use some voicing higher up the neck that would be challenging without a capo.

This can be useful as a compositional tool when you want the guitar to sound like a different higher tuned instrument or to complement a mix lacking in sparkling high end. 

# and why it's not the solution to every problem
Having access to the capo makes [[transposition]] much easier than on any other instrument, this does not mean that using a capo should be your only strategy when transposition is needed. One should be able to play in any [[tonality|key]] in his main tuning even if some will be highly unpractical. 

# capo types
There are a few different types of capos ranging from the cheap elastic band ones to expensive locking mechanisms. Different types offer different pros and cons, the quick capo Kyser style allows for fast movement of the capo at the detriment of intonation and stability while locking capos like Schubb models are very stable but take time to install. 

One also has to be mindful of the [[radius]] of their [[fretboard]] when choosing a capo as well as the [[string spacing]]. A classical guitar needs quite a long capo with a flat radius while a strat will need a shorter one with a radius matching then one of the fretboard. 

I personally use Schubb capos for both my acoustic and classical guitars as I find they offer the best intonation and tuning stability which is more important to me than changing capo position quickly.
