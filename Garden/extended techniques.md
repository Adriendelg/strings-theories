Extended techniques refers to alternative modes of playing the instrument. If the guitar was intended to be a plucked string instruments, there are plenty of other ways to create interesting and useful sounds out of it.

Finding extended technique is about looking at the instrument with fresh eyes, seeing it not as a preconceived notion of what a guitar should be or can do. It's looking at the big picture, thinking out of the box. 

Extended techniques can slightly differ from one [[types|type of guitar]] to another. For example, an acoustic guitar being a wooden box, it allows for percussive moves that an electric guitar can't.
