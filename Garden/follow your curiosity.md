When contemplating the immensity of all the things you could practice it can sometimes be intimidating and hard to know where to start, whose advice to listen to or just what you should do. 

To this situation I can only offer one simple advice, follow your bliss, listen to your curiosity. And its counterpart, don't practice what you don't want to become. 

There will be styles of music you are drawn to, solos you like, chords you find beautiful, artists you admire etc. No one knows why, it's not even necessary to find words, you simply are attracted to it. This is your curiosity, your taste expressing itself. This is a calling you should listen to and honor. When working on things you like, towards goals you truly value, effort will feel much lighter. Practicing won't feel like a chore but like a rewarding endeavour. 

When feeling stuck in a rut, pick one thing you like, one thing that gets you excited and practice just that. 

It's necessary to listen to your teachers, to take inspiration from guitar masters. However just because someone you respect practiced a certain way or learned some material doesn't mean you necessarily should. If something don't excite you, if it doesn't resonate with you don't practice it. Maybe you will develop a taste for it later in your guitar playing journey, maybe you won't and it's ok. 

Life is too short to practice stuff you don't like.

Your musical identity is shaped just as much by the things you don't like and don't do than by the things you do and like.
